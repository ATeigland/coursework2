Abstract = {{We have designed and tested the first polysilicon surface 
   micromachined vibratory rate gyroscope that is sensitive to angular 
   rotation about an axis normal to the plane of the silicon chip, the 
   Z-axis. The Analog Devices, Inc. BiMEMS technology was used to
   fabricate  the gyroscope, which has as a demonstrated minimum
   detectable signal of  1 deg/sec/Hz frac12 with performance projected to
   improve to  0.1 deg/sec/Hz frac12 in a second-generation BiMEMS design.
    Our design makes use of electrostatics to improve performance 
   considerably. Electrostatic frequency tuning of the sense mode is used 
   to enhance sensitivity. Quadrature error due to asymmetries in the 
   vibrating structure is nulled by detecting the resulting motion and 
   applying electrostatic forces by modifying voltages on the 
   interdigitated sense comb fingers to cancel error precisely }},
